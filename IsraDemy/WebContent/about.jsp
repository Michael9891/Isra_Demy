        <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

        <p>Coding skills have never been in higher demand, but traditional computer science courses are often costly, time consuming, and lack the flexibility many people demand. Meanwhile, technology is moving quicker than ever and to stay current, many developers must constantly be learning new skills outside of their day jobs. This has left room for new approaches to code education.</p>

        <p>In our opinion, the best way to learn is by doing. Isrademy opens the door to a new way of learning by combining high-quality video, in-browser coding, and gamification to make learning fun!</p>
